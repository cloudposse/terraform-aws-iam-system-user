Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM system user suitable for CI/CD Systems
(_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user/releases).


```hcl
module "circleci" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "circleci"
  name       = "assets"
}
```




## Examples

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "fluentd_user_policy" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "logs:DescribeDestinations",
      "logs:DescribeExportTasks",
      "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
      "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
      "logs:DescribeMetricFilters",
      "logs:DescribeSubscriptionFilters",
      "logs:FilterLogEvents",
      "logs:GetLogEvents",
      "logs:CreateLogGroup",
      "logs:CreateLogStream",
      "logs:PutLogEvents",
      "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
      "logs:CreateLogStream",
      "logs:DeleteLogStream",
    ]

    resources = ["*"]
  }
}

module "fluentd_user" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "dev"
  name      = "fluentd"
}


resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "default" {
  name   = "${module.fluentd_user.user_name}"
  user   = "${module.fluentd_user.user_name}"
  policy = "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.fluentd_user_policy.json}"
}
```
