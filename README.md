Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM system user suitable for CI/CD Systems
(_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html)
or [AWS OIDC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).

We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources. IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended that IAM policies be applied directly to groups and roles but not users.
**This module intentionally attaches an IAM policy directly to the user and does not use groups**

The IAM user name is constructed using [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label)
and some input is required. The simplest input is `name`. By default the name will be converted to lower case
and all non-alphanumeric characters except for hyphen will be removed. See the documentation for `terraform-null-label`
to learn how to override these defaults if desired.

If an AWS Access Key is created, it is stored either in SSM Parameter Store or is provided as a module output,
but not both. Using SSM Parameter Store is recommended because module outputs are stored in plaintext in
the Terraform state file.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).
>
> <details>
> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/main/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>
> </detalis>





## Usage

```hcl
module "circleci" {
  source = "cloudposse/iam-system-user/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "circleci"
  name       = "assets"
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.





## Examples

```hcl
module "fluentd_user" {
  source = "cloudposse/iam-system-user/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "dev"
  name      = "fluentd"

  policy_arns_map = {
    logs = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess"
  }

  inline_policies_map = {
    s3 = data.aws_iam_policy_document.s3_policy.json
  }
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "s3_policy" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:GetObjectAcl",
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:ListBucket",
      "s3:PutObjectAcl"
    ]

    resources = [
      "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*",
      "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/"
    ]
  }
}
```
