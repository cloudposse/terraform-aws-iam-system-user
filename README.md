# terraform-aws-iam-system-user [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM system user suitable for CI/CD Systems
(_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

We do not recommend creating IAM users this way for any other purpose.

  namespace  = "cp"
  stage      = "circleci"
  name       = "assets"
}
```




## Examples

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "fluentd_user_policy" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "logs:DescribeDestinations",

    ]

    resources = ["*"]
  }
}

module "fluentd_user" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "dev"
  name      = "fluentd"
}


resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "default" {
  name   = "${module.fluentd_user.user_name}"
  user   = "${module.fluentd_user.user_name}"
  policy = "${data.aws_iam_policy_document.fluentd_user_policy.json}"
}
```
